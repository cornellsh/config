# Limit resource usage to avoid starving the host.
# IMPORTANT: Carefully adjust these values based on your host machine's hardware for optimal WSL2 performance and stability!
# Insufficient resources can lead to slowdowns, while excessive allocation can starve your host OS.
# For example, if you have 16GB RAM, allocating 8GB for WSL is a reasonable starting point. For 32GB RAM, consider 16GB.
memory=8GB
